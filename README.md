I'm a developer that specializes in Games, Websites, & Graphics. I have been playing games since I was a child & after I graduated from highschool, I took a risk & decided to make it my passion. My dream is to work in anything graphics related such as Shaders, Graphics Specializations (OpenGL/DX/VULKAN), Rendering Topics, & etc. This is essentially my biggest dream, to work & specialize in the graphics space. Scroll down to check some cool repositories if you're interested!

### ðŸš§ Iâ€™m currently working on the following:
1. Writing my own [Raytracer](https://github.com/j-2k/Raytracing).
2. My Graphics Based [Website](https://github.com/j-2k/GraphicsWebsite).
3. Documenting my learning progress on my [github website](https://j-2k.github.io).

### ðŸŽ¨ Constantly trying to Learn & Master:
1. Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/CG).
2. Graphics Related Topics.
3. C++.
