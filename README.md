I'm a Game Developer constantly trying to improve my skills at many things I currently use Unity & enjoy shader programming in it. I hope later on I can make my own graphics engine for fun since I have a major interest in Shaders & Graphics specifically ✨OpenGL & Vulkan✨ & hope to learn more about ⚙️Engine Development⚙️ in the future.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on small side projects & trying to expose myself to much more C++!
- 🌱 I’m also trying to learn & get better at many things especially the ones listed below!
- 🎨 Shaders / CG | Data Structures / Algorithims | CS | Reverse Engineering 🛠
