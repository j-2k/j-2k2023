### 👋 Hello, I'm Juma! 👋
### ***My custom first ever tree shader!***
***I forgot to change the culling so it looks a little weird ignore that 🤦🤣***

I'm a developer that specializes in Games, Websites, & Graphics. I have been playing games since I was a child & after I graduated from highschool, I took a risk & decided to make it my passion. My dream is to work in anything graphics related such as Shaders, Graphics Specializations (OpenGL/DX/VULKAN), Rendering Topics, & etc. This is essentially my biggest dream, to work & specialize in the graphics space. Scroll down to check some cool repositories if you're interested!

### 🚧 I’m currently working on the following:<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=j-2k&layout=compact&theme=cobalt" />
1. [Shader Showcase](https://github.com/j-2k/ShaderShowcase) project.

### 📝 My busy to-do list:
1. Write my first compute shader [(Raytracer + Compute shader Unity)](http://three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/03/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1/)
2. Finish writing the raytracing project blog on my [website](https://j-2k.github.io/raytracingproject)  

### ♾️ Constantly trying to master:
1. Writing Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/CG).  
2. Data structures & algorithms
3. C# & C++

- 💬 Informal / Casual talk can be on discord, will put a new ID here soon.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have combined over 10,000+ hours in-game time in many different games across my lifetime & played competitively in some of them.

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 

$$R = R_x(\alpha) \cdot R_y(\beta) \cdot R_z(\gamma)$$

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\gamma)\cos(\beta) & -\sin(\gamma)\cos(\alpha) + \cos(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\sin(\alpha) & \sin(\gamma)\sin(\alpha) + \cos(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha) \\
\sin(\gamma)\cos(\beta) & \cos(\gamma)\cos(\alpha) + \sin(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\sin(\alpha) & -\cos(\gamma)\sin(\alpha) + \sin(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha) \\
-\sin(\beta) & \cos(\beta)\sin(\alpha) & \cos(\beta)\cos(\alpha) \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Good to know after so much time wasted that mathjax is supported natively on MD & on GH-pages but needs only a import.
