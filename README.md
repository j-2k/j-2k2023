I'm a Game Developer constantly trying to improve my skills at many things I currently use Unity & enjoy shader programming in it. I hope later on I can make my own graphics engine for fun since I have a major interest in Shaders & Graphics specifically ✨OpenGL & Vulkan✨ & hope to learn more about ⚙️Engine Development⚙️ in the future.
- 🚧 I’m currently working on the following:
1. Writing my own Raytracer.
2. Learning little Web Development.
3. Documenting my learning progress in programming on my [github website](j-2k.github.io).

- 🎨 Constantly trying to Learn & Master:
1. Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/CG).
2. Data Structures / Algorithims.
3. Computer Science Topics.
4. C++.
