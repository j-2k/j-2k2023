I'm a developer that specializes in Games, Websites, & Graphics. I have been playing games since I was a child & after I graduated from highschool, I took a risk & decided to make it my passion. My dream is to work in anything graphics related such as Shaders, Graphics Specializations (OpenGL/DX/VULKAN), Rendering Topics, & etc. This is essentially my biggest dream, to work & specialize in the graphics space. Scroll down to check some cool repositories if you're interested!

### ðŸš§ Iâ€™m currently working on the following:
1. Writing my own [Raytracer](https://github.com/j-2k/Raytracing).
2. My Graphics Based [Website](https://github.com/j-2k/GraphicsWebsite).
3. Documenting my learning progress on my [github website](https://j-2k.github.io).

### ðŸŽ¨ Constantly trying to Learn & Master:
1. Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/CG).
2. Graphics Related Topics.
3. C++.

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 

$$R = R_x(\alpha) \cdot R_y(\beta) \cdot R_z(\gamma)$$

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\gamma)\cos(\beta) & -\sin(\gamma)\cos(\alpha) + \cos(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\sin(\alpha) & \sin(\gamma)\sin(\alpha) + \cos(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha) \\
\sin(\gamma)\cos(\beta) & \cos(\gamma)\cos(\alpha) + \sin(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\sin(\alpha) & -\cos(\gamma)\sin(\alpha) + \sin(\gamma)\sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha) \\
-\sin(\beta) & \cos(\beta)\sin(\alpha) & \cos(\beta)\cos(\alpha) \\
\end{bmatrix}

Good to know after so much time wasted that mathjax is supported natively on MD & on GH-pages but needs only a import.
