### 👋 Hello, I'm Juma! 👋

---
I'm a Game Developer constantly trying to improve my skills at many things I currently use Unity & really enjoy Shader programming in it. I hope later on I can make my own graphics engine for fun since I have a major interest in Shaders, Graphics specifically ✨ OpenGL & Vulkan ✨, & Engine Development ⚙️.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Zolanore, a Challenging RPG game with art similar to Genshin Impact & Zelda BOTW
- 🌱 I’m currently learning shader programming
- 📫 Need to reach me? My discord is kenzo#2790
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have over 10,000+ hours in game time across my lifetime
